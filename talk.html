  <h2>
    Physical Benefits
  </h2>
<p>  
  Everyone has always heard from their parents, teachers, and other adults that exercise is an important thing to do in everyday life. 
  Of course, everybody knows that exercise can help improve your strength, increase your stamina, and help you lose fat, but what some 
  people don't realize is how much exercise can impact our bodies. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm">
  cdc.gov,<a/> "Heart disease and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in the United States" and if you exercise, you can reduce 
  the risk of contracting these diseases because exercising works out your heart muscles and thickens your blood vessel walls. In addition, 
  exercise can help prevent type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. 
  </p>
  <h2>
    Mental Benefits
  </h2>
<p>
  Although the physical benefits of exercise are numerous, the mental benefits of exercise are just as important. Did you know
  that exercise releases endorphins in your body? Endorphin is one of the chemicals in your brain that rewards the body for doing
  things that are beneficial to it such as eating and sleeping. According to 
  <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm">helpguide.org,</a> exercise 
  "relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins." Knowing 
  that people at Stuy are often overstressed due to the amount of work that is demanded of them, exercise is a great way to relieve 
  some of that stress!

  <h2>
    How to Start Exercising
  </h2>
<p>
  If you've never exercised consistently before in your life, it's better to start sooner than later. The most important aspect of 
  exercise is routine. If you consistently exercise at certain times of the day, it will soon become a habit for you which
  makes it easier to not make excuses for not exercising. However, if you really believe that you are not responsible enough to 
  hold yourself accountable, try doing it with someone else or join an exercise club at school. You can join sports teams at school 
  or you can join some more casual health clubs such as Stuyvesant RoadRunners. Here is a post that I've written if you want to start 
  exercising but don't know what exercises to do. <a href="https://stuyroadrunners.wixsite.com/stuyrr/post/quick-workouts">Quick Workouts</a>
